## Insights and Observations from the SAMSum Dataset

### What Kind of Text is Hard to Summarize?
- **Context-Dependent Dialogues**: Dialogues with implicit references (e.g., "the party" in sample 5) are challenging because the model lacks external context, leading to incomplete summaries that miss key details.
- **Multi-Speaker Interactions**: Conversations with multiple speakers (e.g., sample 6) confuse the model, as it struggles to attribute actions or intentions correctly, often mixing up who said what.
- **Informal Language and Slang**: Dialogues with slang, abbreviations (e.g., "gr8" in sample 2), or emojis (e.g., sample 1) result in summaries that either omit these elements or misinterpret them, producing overly formal or incorrect outputs.
- **Longer Dialogues**: Lengthy conversations (e.g., sample 5) overwhelm the model’s token limit or attention, causing it to focus on early parts and ignore later details, resulting in truncated or unbalanced summaries.

### Recurring Errors
- **Omission of Key Details**: The model often skips critical information, like the purpose of a conversation (e.g., sample 1 omits that Hannah needs to contact Larry).
- **Repetition**: Some summaries repeat phrases unnecessarily (e.g., sample 2 repeats dialogue snippets verbatim instead of summarizing).
- **Incorrect Attribution**: In multi-speaker dialogues, the model may attribute actions to the wrong person (e.g., sample 5 misattributes party planning).
- **Overgeneralization**: The model sometimes produces vague summaries that lose specificity (e.g., sample 6 reduces a detailed lunch plan to a generic statement).
- **Direct Dialogue Copying**: Instead of abstractive summarization, the model occasionally copies dialogue chunks (e.g., sample 3), failing to condense or rephrase.

### How Well Does the Model Handle Dialogue-Style Data?
- **Strengths**:
  - BART captures main ideas in short, clear dialogues (e.g., sample 8) reasonably well, producing fluent summaries.
  - It handles single-topic conversations effectively, summarizing the core intent when context is explicit (e.g., sample 9).
- **Weaknesses**:
  - Struggles with multi-turn dialogues where context evolves (e.g., sample 5), missing later updates like cancellations or rescheduling.
  - Informal elements (slang, emojis) are often ignored or misinterpreted, reducing summary richness.
  - Speaker dynamics are poorly captured, especially in group chats, leading to confusion about roles or outcomes.
- **Overall**: BART performs moderately well for simple dialogues but falters with complexity, requiring fine-tuning or better preprocessing for dialogue-specific tasks.

### Preprocessing and Post-Processing Applied
- **Preprocessing**:
  - **Length Filtering**: Dialogues and summaries were filtered to 512 and 128 tokens, respectively, to avoid truncation during tokenization. This ensured complete inputs but excluded ~5% of longer samples, potentially biasing toward simpler dialogues.
  - **Stripping Whitespace**: Removed extra whitespace to standardize inputs, improving tokenization consistency.
  - **No Emoji Handling**: Emojis (e.g., in sample 1) were retained as SAMSum is clean, but this caused issues as BART ignored them, losing emotional cues.
- **Post-Processing**:
  - **None Applied**: Summaries were used as generated to evaluate raw model performance. However, I noticed redundant phrases could be trimmed (e.g., repeated names in sample 3).
  - **Why**: Focused on evaluating BART’s out-of-the-box capabilities. Post-processing like redundancy removal or formality adjustment could be added to improve readability but wasn’t critical for this experiment.
- **Rationale**: Preprocessing was minimal to preserve dialogue authenticity, but more aggressive cleaning (e.g., slang normalization) could help. Post-processing was avoided to isolate model errors for analysis.
